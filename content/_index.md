        I've been working in parasite chemosensory research for around two years now with my current lab. It's been a very fun experience and something that has really impacted me as a scientist! 
        
        I'm going to be presenting at CERCA 2025 here at UWEC and am excited to share my research!
        
        I'm almost finished with my undergraduate career and plan on applying to grad school for fall of 2026.

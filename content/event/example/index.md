summary: 'wrmXpress GUI: A user-friendly interface for high-throughput analysis of parasitic worms'
abstract: 'As antiparasitic research moves towards high-content and high-throughput phenotypic screening, computation of large imaging datasets will play a significant role. The data generated by automated microscopy is invaluable to researchers as it is highly detailed and at an unprecedented scale. However, processing these data is a challenging task, requiring researchers to develop custom tools, use closedsource proprietary code integrated into the microscopeâ€™s software, or adapt publicly available opensource software. However, creating custom tools and working in the command line poses a barrier to entry for many researchers. With these considerations in mind, we have developed an open-source tool with a user-friendly GUI to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of high-content imaging data across diverse worm species. wrmXpress is an open-source tool designed to quickly analyze the data received from automated microscopy imaging with a special focus on parasitic worms. The new wrmXpress GUI incorporated all previously published modules, and we also introduce a new module for tracking schistosome miracidia in a high-throughput context. '

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Hugo Blox Builder's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/content-types/) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page.
